# llms-graphs
test repo to learn and try to implement a system to execute llms as a DAG graph (This has no other purpose than to satisfy my curiosity)

# Plans

 - ~~Structure repo~~
 - ~~Make graph use node features~~
 - ~~Make graph use vertex featuers~~
 - ~~Do a full test of graphs with LLM Features~~

 - Make a use case with tests added
 - Run tests of said use case
 - Add a feature engineering part to discard noisy features that doesn't add nothing
 - Add a prompt improving part
 - Add a LLM independent part
