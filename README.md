# llms-graphs
test repo to learn and try to implement a system to execute llms as a DAG graph (This has no other purpose than to satisfy my curiosity)

# Plans

 - ~~Structure repo~~
 - ~~Make graph use node features~~
 - ~~Make graph use vertex featuers~~
 - Do a full test of graphs with LLM Features
